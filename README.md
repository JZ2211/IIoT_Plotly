# IIoT Workshop - Week 8 
## Project: Plotly Dash Example

## How to use 
Modify the configs at the top of the dashapp_examle.py code and run the example code: ```python dashapp_example.py```
1. ***dashapp_example.py***: plots and deploy in the localhost using flask
You can also draw the plots using a log_yyyy_mm_dd.txt file
2. ***firebase_retrieve.py***: implement a function to retrieve data from a given path for a given duration and save the data as a json file. 
You can also export the json file for a path directly from firebase project page.
3. ***json2csv.py****: implement a function to convert a json file to a csv file so that plotly can use it to draw plots
Call this one if you only have a json data file.
